/**
 * Class Trees is the representation of all the Trees in the Forest. 
 * It computes following parameters:
 * @numberOfType1Trees,numberOfType2Trees,numberOfType3Trees: The amount of each tree type
 * @AverageWeightOfType1Trees: The average weight of a specific tree type
 * @AverageWeightOfType1Trees: average weight of all tree types
 * @NumberOfType1Pests: density of pests per M2
 * @type1TreesAverageProximityValue: That shows how close the trees of a definite tree type are .this factor also shows compatibility of each tree type
 * @sunlightSufficiencyPerYear: Shows the sufficiency level of sunlight during a year
 * @precipitationSufficiencyPerYear:shows sufficiency level of precipitation through a year(4 seasons in general)
 * @generatedCO2ByDeadType1Trees: amount of generated CO2 by dead trees of a definite type

 // BAD: During writing this code i decided first to build it by extending the Tree class. but later i figured out that it's not a good approach and
 // it's better to include a member variable of the Tree class inside the Trees class so that i can instantiate several trees with specific
 // properties(age,type,...). Thus in later version i do not use the extension and use a member variable of type Tree instead!
