/**
 * Class Forest is a representation of all the entities in the Forest.
 * It is the superclass of Classes Trees and Accounting
 * It takes in the Input from the User and gives back the required values.
 * 
 * @forestTrees: So far, we have only implemented Trees into our Forest, so we
 * can only provide Feedback for those
 * 
 * @author Andreas Merckel
 * 
 * Forest uses the subclass Trees to calculate the trees. For this, we call
 * Trees with the required values (e.g. new Trees(mixed, 100) and should receive
 * the age, value and resistance as Integers resp.
 * Forest also calls the class Accounting to calculate the absolute value of
 * the Trees.
 * 
 * I am not overly sure if Accounting has to be its own class or should be 
 * implemented as a method
