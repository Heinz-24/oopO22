/**
 * Class Trees is the representation of all the Trees in the Forest. It takes in
 * (=is a superclass of) Tree and Harvest. 
 * It computes following parameters:
 * @treeTypes: The amount of types of trees
 * @avgWeight: The average weight of all the trees (which correlates with CO2 
 * and age)
 * @avgResistance: How healthy the trees are
 * @specResistance: In case of special incidents, how likely is this group of
 * trees to survive?
 * @maxWeight: How far is this group of trees removed from its maximal Weight
 * @avgRotting: The trees that are already dead generate CO2. How much?
 * @avgComp: How compatible is this group of trees on average. Can i introduce
 * some trees to make it more compatible?
